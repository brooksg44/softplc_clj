# Program to drive a Simple Conveyor
# X1=EStop, X2=Stop, X3=Start, Y1=Belt Conveyor

# This program implements a simple start/stop circuit with an emergency stop.
# When Start (X3) is pressed, the conveyor (Y1) runs.
# Once running, the conveyor continues even if Start is released.
# The conveyor stops if Stop (X2) is pressed or EStop (X1) is pressed.
